// a global store is used to save some temporary data shared between components. (e.g. poster name for dialogue)
// when some data is hard to pass around between components, (e.g. one of the component is in route root level), we can put the data in the temporary store

// FIXME: it seems that we do not really, probably delete it in future
// export class Store {
//   public dialogue:{
//     recipientName:string,
//   };

//   public constructor() {
//     this.dialogue = {
//       recipientName:'',
//     };
//   }

// }
